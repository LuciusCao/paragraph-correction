In the summer holiday following my eighteenth birthday, I took driving lessons. I still remember how hard {my, the} first day was. Before getting into the car, I thought I had learned the instructor’s orders, {but, yet} once I started the car, my mind went blank. I forgot what he had said to me altogether. The instructor kept repeating the words, “Speed up!” “Slow down!” “Turn left!” I was so nervous that I could hardly tell which direction was left. A few minutes later, the instructor asked me to stop the car. It was a relief and I came to a sudden stop just in the middle of the road.
